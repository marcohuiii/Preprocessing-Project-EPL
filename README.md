# Premier League Data Preprocessing Project ⚽

This repository contains a cleaned and structured dataset of English Premier League (EPL) football data, designed for easy use in analytics and data visualization projects. The aim is to provide a reliable and well-preprocessed dataset that others can use as a foundation for machine learning, dashboards, and other data science work.

## 📌 Project Purpose

- ✅ Practice and demonstrate data preprocessing skills
- 📊 Enable others to explore, analyze, and visualize EPL team performance
- 🧹 Provide a semi-processed dataset to save time for other data analysts or students
