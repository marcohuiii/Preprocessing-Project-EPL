# English Premier League (EPL) Match Data Preprocessing Project ⚽

## Objective

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing English Premier League (EPL) match data to produce a well-structured, analysis-ready dataset.
The goal is to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow where raw, inconsistent data is transformed into a reliable resource — enabling downstream insights, modeling, or visualization.

## Business & Learning Context

In both business and academic settings, access to clean data is a major barrier to good analysis. This project serves two purposes:

Business simulation: Mimicking what analysts in sports, betting, or media companies do to make match data usable.

Community support: Providing a high-quality starting point for those who want to analyze EPL data without having to do all the tedious cleaning themselves.

## Folder Structure


- `data/`
  - `raw/` – Original downloaded dataset
  - `processed/` – Cleaned dataset (CSV or Parquet)

- `eda/`
  - `exploratory.ipynb` – Initial exploration & visual checks

## Key Steps in This Project

- Initial Exploration: Review of data types, missing values, and column descriptions.

- Column Refinement: Removal of redundant or irrelevant fields.

- Date Standardization: Proper conversion of match date formats.

- Missing Value Handling: Identification and removal of rows with incomplete data.

- Column Reordering: For better readability and logical flow.

- Data Type Casting: Ensuring numerical and categorical consistency across all features.

- Exporting Cleaned Data: Final version is saved for reuse and public access.


## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git for version control


## Use Cases

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
